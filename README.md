## About the Video Course
GameMaker: Studio is a fairly cheap, but solid entry route into game development. Due to a low startup cost, cheap asset pipelines, and the ability to publish games without paying royalties, it's a great way for novice game developers to produce their first games without having to first learn a complex programming language. An inbuilt and easy-to-understand programming language called Game Maker Language (GML) can be used to program your games and create advanced systems with ease.

Building a 2D Game with GameMaker: Studio will demonstrate everything from the main interface and programming to creating an artificial intelligence, teaching you everything you need to know in order to create your own games in GameMaker: Studio.

This course is a step-by-step walkthrough that will showcase GameMaker: Studio and Game Maker Language (GML) through a series of small, practical examples. These examples consist of concise videos that demonstrate the essential programming techniques and concepts that you'll need to get started in game development.

You'll begin with an overview of the interface to familiarize yourself with it, and steadily work your way towards building a platformer with all the usual trimmings such as a score counter, health monitor, enemies, and even artificial intelligence.

You will then learn about things such as animating sprites, using objects, best practices when creating resources, and much more, all of which leads up to creating a platformer game. 
Building a 2D Game with GameMaker: Studio covers everything you need to use GameMaker: Studio and will lay the groundwork for future games of your own.
